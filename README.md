# Data Structures & Algorithms in C++ ðŸš€

Welcome to my **DSA Journey in C++** repository! This collection documents my learning and implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++. It covers essential concepts, from basic to advanced, with an emphasis on efficient problem-solving techniques and algorithmic optimizations.

## Topics Covered:

- **Stacks & Queues**: LIFO/FIFO structures, circular queues, deque  
- **Linked Lists**: Singly, doubly, and circular linked lists  
- **Trees & Graphs**: Binary trees, BSTs, DFS, BFS, and shortest path algorithms  
- **Hashing**: Hash tables, collision handling  
- **Sorting & Searching**: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Binary Search  
- **Recursion & Backtracking**: N-Queens, Sudoku solver, combinatorial problems  
- **Dynamic Programming**: Knapsack problem, Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS), Longest Common Subsequence (LCS), and memoization

This repository is a testament to my commitment to mastering DSA and improving my algorithmic thinking. It serves as both a personal reference and a resource for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of C++ and DSA.

## Learning Path:
- Start with basic data structures, explore algorithms, and gradually move towards advanced topics.
- Implementation and optimization are key components, ensuring both theoretical knowledge and practical coding skills.

## Technologies Used:
- **Language**: C++
